# NASASARP2020
This is a repository for all of the code I wrote during my [NASA Student Airborne Research Program](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/earthscience/programs/airbornescience/studentairborneresearchprogram) internship.
Students in the program were sorted (at random) into one of four groups that represent earth science research at NASA: Terrestrial Ecology, Ocean Remote Sensing,
Aerosols, and Whole Air Sampling. My group was Whole Air Sampling (WAS) which was led by Dr. Donald Blake, a professor at UC Irvine. In the WAS group, we studied 
the compositions of different compounds in earth's atmosphere that were sampled using NASA aircraft and air canister technology. We then developed independent 
research projects with that air composition data. My project focused specifically on an irregular blend of compounds found high in the atmosphere. 
By using data analysis and visualization in python coupled with some NASA satellite data, I was able to link the airmass to a wildfire in Southern California that
was raging at the time, and marine emissions from algal blooms in an inland sea. 

The code that I wrote contains:

Data wrangling of our huge, ~5000 line and ~200 column database. It contains air composition data for over 100 compounds, taken over 11 years (~40 flights!) in 
the Los Angeles Basin.

Introductory scatterplots that allow easy and quick comparison between a variety of variables along 4 axes (x, y, color, point size). This was essential for me
when I was getting started and had to identify potentially interesting projects within the dauntingly large database.

3D Mapping code which was useful in visualizing flight paths and the mapping out various compositions over their duration.
